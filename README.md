# 6_digit_DoorLock
This is a doorlock implementation using verilog. Some features are added to make a physical connection. I initially planned to connect to the 4x4 keypad, but I had a minor problem and changed it to getting input to the switch on the FPGA. The FPGA board used is Xilinx's Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board.
